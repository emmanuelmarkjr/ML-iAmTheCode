# ML-iAmTheCode

A Machine Learning Algorithm was developed, trained and tested with some dataset generated by me as a result unavilability to access real life dataset

The Dataset comprises basically Four Features which includes number of beds, female occupants, under18, time of stay, and an output which indicates the Risk Of Trafficking for the particular booking.

On cases whereby a user goes to some hotel booking website(Booking.com), as user submits data, data is sent and tested with the algorithm, the machine would be able to tell whether such booking has a high or low risk of trafficking, and if High, respective measures would be set in place.

Develped with Python.
